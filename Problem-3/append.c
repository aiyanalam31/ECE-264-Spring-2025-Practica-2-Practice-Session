/*
 * append.c
 *
 * Recursively appends a new node with a given key and value to the end of a linked list.
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * - Do not change the Node struct.
 * - You must solve this recursively.
 * - Do not use loops.
 * - If head is NULL, create a new node and return it.
 * - Make sure to copy the key properly using strncpy.
